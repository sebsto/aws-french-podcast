This project uses NodeJS, Webpack, and SaSS to generate the build directory. Then, we use the [Toucan static web site generator](https://github.com/toucansites/toucan) to build the final web site with actual content.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Any change to `index.html` must manually be reported to Toucan's template files (`'.mustache` files)

## Build procedure

### Phase 1 - WebPack 

Node version used is `23.3.0` as indicated by the .nvmrc file.

#### Install dependencies 

`npm i`

#### Scripts

`npm start` - Use for running webpack and opening a live server for development (optional).

`npm run build` - Use to just create a distribution in the `build` folder.

`npm run copy` - To copy the assets file to the static web site generator asset's directory.

### Phase 2 - Integrate content 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> `index.html` was manually split to `mustache` template files.
> Any changes to `index.html` must be reported manually to the corresponding `.mustache` files in the `toucan/themes/aws_podcasts` directory

> [!NOTE]
> To install `toucan`: 
> 1. be sure [a Swift compiler](https://www.swift.org/install/linux/) is installed on your machine
> 2. `git clone https://github.com/toucansites/toucan`
> 3. `cd toucan && sudo make install`

#### Build a preview of the web site 

`make dev` - Use to generate a local version of the web site with actual content.

`make serve` - Use to start a local web server to preview the local version

```sh
make dev && make serve

open http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

#### Deploy 

```sh
make prod
```

Then, copy the content of the `./dist` directory to your web server.

In the context of this project, a `git commit && git push` will trigger the build and deployment on the AWS podcast website at [https://francais.podcast.go-aws.com/web/index.html](https://francais.podcast.go-aws.com/web/index.html)

## Update the build and deploy pipeline 

The build and deploy pipeline is defined in the `cdk/pipeline/lib` directory. Any change to the buid process or deployment must be done in the CDK.

To deploy the pipeline :

```sh
cdk --profile xxx deploy
```

## Test AWS CodeBuild locally 

### Pull the CodeBuild local agent

`docker pull amazon/aws-codebuild-local`

### Run the build

First time: 
```sh 
# build the custom codebuild container
docker build cdk/docker -t adp:arm64
# Get the codebuild agent
docker pull amazon/aws-codebuild-local
# get the script to launch the build
curl -O  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-codebuild-docker-images/master/local_builds/codebuild_build.sh
```

Run the build:
```sh
./codebuild_build.sh -i adp:latest -a .
```
