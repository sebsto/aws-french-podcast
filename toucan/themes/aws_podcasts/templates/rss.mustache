				AWS Technical Instructor with a knack for simplifying the complex. Together, we will step
				into the realm of performance, where we untangle the complexities of designing
				high-performing architectures in the cloud. We dissect the essentials of high-performing
				storage solutions, dive deep into elastic compute services for scaling and cost efficiency,
				and unravel the intricacies of optimizing database solutions for unparalleled performance.
				Expect to uncover:

				• The spectrum of AWS storage services and their optimal use cases, from Amazon S3's
				versatility to the shared capabilities of Amazon EFS.
				• How to leverage Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, and Load Balancing to create elastic compute
				solutions that adapt to your needs.
				• Insights into serverless computing paradigms with AWS Lambda and Fargate, highlighting the
				shift towards de-coupled architectures.
				• Strategies for selecting high-performing database solutions, including the transition from
				on-premise databases to AWS-managed services like RDS and the benefits of caching with
				Amazon ElastiCache.
				• A real-world scenario where we'll navigate the challenge of processing hundreds of
				thousands of online votes in minutes, testing your understanding and application of
				high-performing AWS architectures.

				Whether you're dealing with vast amounts of data, requiring robust compute power, or
				ensuring your architecture can handle peak loads without a hitch, we've got you covered!

			<itunes:summary>In this episode, join Dave and Jacquie as they sit down with Zach Koncir, Tech
				Lead at Riot Games, and Ashwin Raghuraman, Senior Solutions Architect at AWS supporting Riot
				Games. Dive into the dynamic world of Riot Games, the creative force behind iconic titles
				like League of Legends (LoL) and Valorant.

				Discover Riot's innovative approach to reshaping the gaming experience with Riot Direct.
				This initiative has revolutionized the way Riot collaborates with Internet Service
				Providers, moving from traditional 'hot-potato routing' to intelligent packet routing. This
				shift significantly reduces player ping times, a critical factor in competitive esports
				gaming. We also explore Riot Games' strategic move to the cloud, particularly their adoption
				of Kubernetes, which marks a transformative step in their game development process. This
				transition not only streamlines operations but also opens up new horizons for innovation and
				agility in game creation.

				In a groundbreaking move, Riot Games has introduced 'Voice Toxicity Tech' to foster
				healthier, more inclusive gaming communities. This episode delves into how this technology
				combats negative behavior, ensuring a respectful and enjoyable environment for all players.
				Join us as we discuss how Riot Games is leveraging cloud technology to redefine game
				development and create extraordinary player experiences today!

			<itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave and Emily catch up with Elad Ben-Israel, CEO at Wing
				Cloud and original creator of the AWS CDK.

				Winglang is new programming language and toolchain designed for the cloud from the ground
				up. It gives developers a unified way of accessing their cloud infrastructure and code using
				a single language, while still being able to run and test inside a local simulator for high
				speed iterations.

				Elad takes on a historical journey to the original creation of the AWS CDK, the shift from
				coding for single machines to modern distributed cloud-based systems, the power of open
				source, and the continued evolution of writing software. There may even be an analogy to
				burning man and building software as a community.

			<itunes:summary>Join us in this insightful episode as we welcome back the inimitable Brian
				Tarbox, an AWS Community Hero and Alexa Champion, whose expertise is steeped in over thirty
				years of hands-on experience in the tech industry. With an impressive track record that
				includes ten patents, a slew of papers under his belt, and the co-leadership of the Boston
				AWS Meetup, Brian's insights are nothing short of invaluable.

				In this lively and engaging conversation, Emily, Dave, and Brian traverse the burgeoning
				landscape of technological terminology, exploring how definitions and interpretations have
				evolved over time. Specifically, they delve into the concept of &quot;Serverless&quot; - a
				term that, like many in our industry, has undergone significant transformation since its
				inception. What does Serverless mean in 2023? Brian, with his deep knowledge and candid
				demeanor, unpacks this in a way that is both easy to grasp and thought-provoking.

				This episode is not just a feast for your ears, but also a metaphorical banquet, as Brian
				masterfully utilizes metaphors to bring clarity to these often-complex concepts. It's a
				lively and humorous ride through the often-puzzling labyrinth of tech jargon, punctuated by
				heaps of fun and laughter.

				So, whether you're a seasoned tech veteran or a curious newcomer, tune in to this episode
				and savor the knowledge-rich discussion between Emily, Dave, and Brian. Be prepared to
				laugh, learn, and see the tech world through a fresh lens. It's an episode you won't want to
				miss!

			<itunes:summary>In this episode, Linda, Emily, and Dave chat with Jon Handler, Sr. Principal
				Solutions Architect at AWS, and Ashok Thirunarayanan, Senior SDM, Search Service at AWS.
				Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand serverless configuration for Amazon OpenSearch
				Service. Serverless removes the operational complexities of provisioning, configuring, and
				tuning your OpenSearch clusters. It's a good option for organizations that don't want to
				self-manage their OpenSearch clusters, or organizations that don't have the dedicated
				resources or expertise to operate large clusters. With OpenSearch Serverless, you can easily
				search and analyze a large volume of data without having to worry about the underlying
				infrastructure and data management. Jon and Ashok cover how they built OpenSearch
				Serverless, how they think about search technology and removing complexity, how developers
				can get started with this new feature, and what has got them excited about the future of
				search.

			<itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Keyur Diwan Sr. Product Manager,
				Amazon RDS. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed
				services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Amazon
				RDS recently launched fully managed Blue/Green Deployments to help you with safer, simpler,
				and faster updates to your Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS databases. Blue/Green Deployments
				create a fully managed staging environment that allows you to deploy and test production
				changes, keeping your current production database safe. With a single click, you can promote
				the staging environment to be the new production system in as fast as a minute, with no
				changes to your application and no data loss. Keyur walks us through this new feature, how
				to get started, how customers are using it today, and what’s next for RDS.

				PostgreSQL is an open source development kit for building PostgreSQL extensions that allows
				developers to build high performance PostgreSQL extensions and safely run them on your RDS
				for PostgreSQL DB instance. By using Trusted Language Extensions (TLE) for PostgreSQL,
				developers can create PostgreSQL extensions that follow the documented approach for
				extending PostgreSQL functionality. Both Johns discuss building this new service update, and

			<itunes:summary>In this episode, Emily and Dave chat with Tarun Rai Madan, Sr. Product Manager
				for AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda SnapStart for Java offers up to 10x faster function startup
				performance at no extra cost. Lambda SnapStart is a performance optimization that makes it
				easier for you to build highly responsive and scalable Java applications using AWS Lambda,
				without having to provision resources or spend time and effort implementing complex
				performance optimizations. Tarun walks us through what this new feature means for
				developers, how the Lambda team was able to create such improved performance, and how
				developers can enable it today.

			<description>In part two, Dave chats again with Francesco Pochetti, Senior Machine Language
				Engineer at Bolt, and an AWS Machine Learning Hero. In this episode, Francesco dives deep in
				the ML tools on AWS, starting with the tools such as NVIDIA Triton and TensorRT, and how to
				improve processing time for Computer Vision. He also covers Amazon SageMaker, and many other
				AWS ML services as well as deploying ML models using Docker in the best way possible. If you
				missed it, you could listen to part one of this conversation in Episode 045.

			<itunes:summary>In this episode, Dave chats with Nader Dabit, Developer Relations Engineer at
				Edge &amp; Node. In his career, Nader has worn the hats of a web developer, mobile
				developer, AWS cloud developer, and now Web3 developer. Nader is the author behind many of
				the popular, free, developer guides for the Web3 space including: The Complete Guide to Full
				Stack Web3 Development, The Complete Guide to Full Stack Ethereum Development, and The
				Complete Guide to Full Stack Solana Development. In part one of this two-part conversation,
				Nader shares getting started with a full-time career as a developer coming from almost no
				technical background. He then covers the vision of what Web3 is, and regardless of your
				exposure to blockchain, how Web3 will ultimately benefit everyone.

				Note: This episode is an attempt to cover the developer benefits of Web3. It does not
				represent financial advice, or any specific Amazon endorsement of Bitcoin and Crypto
